A showcase of programs I've built

Programs:

hash-compare.py - A script to compare the hash of a file to the hash on a website, used to verify file has not been modified.

nfl_schedule_rate.py - A script to pull a specified week of NFL games, then rate the games based on how good each team is. The idea here is to rate games without knowing the final score, thus a spoiler free rating system.

pcap_analyser - This was my university project for my introductory python class, it opens a pcap file and pulls relevent data from it.
